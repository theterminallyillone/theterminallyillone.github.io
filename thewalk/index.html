<u>17</u><br><br>
solitary cigarettess<br>
burnt beneath the moonlight<br>
still fleeing my regrets<br>
dreaming we'd reunite<br>
<br>
deluding my crazed head<br>
with thoughts of your return<br>
my feet weighted with lead<br>
one of these nights i'll learn<br>
<br>
i don't live in your veins<br>
the way you've wrangled mine<br>
still mourning our remains<br>
and strengthening my spine<br>
<br>
strumming such doleful chords<br>
for dearly departed<br>
think i'm all out of words<br>
just sour and sordid<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[JAN - 04]<br></div>

<p>
<u>16</u><br><br>
heat waves in a tin can<br>
drenched in that summer rain<br>
whirling that Lasko fan<br>
still crazy for miss jane<br>
<br>
we spent ourselves silly<br>
rolling 'round Florida<br>
it was childish really<br>
stuck in my cerebra<br>
<br>
your explosivity<br>
was so sexy to me<br>
that bold proclivity<br>
and your drive to please me<br>
<br>
the summer of my life<br>
left me with a craving<br>
glad to have called you wife<br>
before i went crazy<br>
<br>
grateful for all our days<br>
but i know they are past<br>
done teaching you my ways<br>
and you're moving on fast<br>
<br>
kittens among the brush<br>
met us along our path<br>
melting my heart to mush<br>
don't want to write of death<br>
<br>
but those miles are behind<br>
somewhere in the rearview<br>
i still love you in kind<br>
maybe i've lost a screw<br>
<br>
but i will 'til i die<br>
hold you as my dearest<br>
don't know how to say bye<br>
but i wish you the best<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[JAN - 02]<br></div>

<u>15</u><br><br>
wish i could erase you<br>
roll you up and blaze you<br>
just fucking efface you<br>
still can't seem to face you<br>
<br>
vices on me so tight<br>
still trying to get right<br>
and somehow see the light<br>
ready to start a fight<br>
<br>
flying high on grape ape<br>
trying to stay in shape<br>
stuck together with tape<br>
head up in the netscape<br>
<br>
suicide on my mind<br>
when you get hard to find<br>
feel like i'm going blind<br>
rending myself from rind<br>

<u>14</u><br><br>
sat serenely smoking<br>
whisking away worries<br>
with this joint i'm burning<br>
whilst twirling these stories<br>
<br>
about my consciousness<br>
in pestilential loops<br>
craving convalescence<br>
praying as my mood droops<br>
<br>
i can't find a bottle<br>
because i'd drink it all<br>
in attempt to throttle<br>
my discordant recall<br>
<br>
still groping for a fix<br>
that only grew pallid<br>
compared to your lips<br>
subject to my ballad<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 30]<br></div>

<p>
<u>13</u><br><br>
under pressure<br>
i'm paranoid<br>
cutting tethers<br>
fucking annoyed<br>
<br>
stomping puddles<br>
beneath my boots<br>
fuck your cuddles<br>
and drug abuse<br>
<br>
i have grass roots<br>
turning up soil<br>
bursting with fruits<br>
for which i toil<br>
<br>
slipping easy<br>
to an old friend<br>
has me wheezy<br>
still i'm condemned<br>
<br>
laid out writhing<br>
in a blood pool<br>
hoarsely screaming<br>
like i'm some ghoul<br>
<br>
soul in a bind<br>
for the lover<br>
that saw my mind<br>
molded for her<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 28]<br></div>

<p>
<u>12</u><br><br>
therapeutic discourse<br>
only takes you as far<br>
as your will to disburse<br>
it from your cookie jar<br>
<br>
when the company leaves<br>
so walks the therapy<br>
left alone with your griefs<br>
you'll persist horridly<br>
<br>
mind screaming at the walls<br>
interaction deprived<br>
insisting the quiet stalls<br>
devoid and uncontrived<br>
<br>
absence will devour you<br>
in silence and sadness<br>
but somehow you'll pull through<br>
despite all the madness<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 27]<br></div>

<p>
<u>11</u><br><br>
ever lighter<br>
still balancing<br>
inner viper<br>
focal moulting<br>
<br>
doing better<br>
i'm annealing<br>
made familiar<br>
with allaying<br>
<br>
brutal panging<br>
morbid creature<br>
mind dividing<br>
fuck procedure<br>
<br>
finding healing<br>
expenditure<br>
notwithstanding<br>
on retainer<br>
</p><hr>

<u>10</u><br><br>
adrenaline pumping<br>
i push out such lame rhymes<br>
sublimely devoting<br>
a keyboard to my crimes<br>
<br>
of empassioned labour<br>
i stashed on a shelf<br>
still can't love my neighbor<br>
until i love myself<br>
<br>
but i'm unscrupulous<br>
rioting raucously<br>
quick to turn venomous<br>
swinging pendulously<br>
<br>
young - uncouth and uncaged<br>
channeling all my pain<br>
i am fucking outraged<br>
smoking sweet mary jane<br>
<br>
but she doesn't help me<br>
that bitch is a snake too<br>
i'm ashing out her tree<br>
she has my world askew<br>
<br>
spinning schemes like some wack<br>
i waste myself away<br>
awaiting heart attack<br>
some reprieve from the fray<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 25]<br></div>

<p>
<u>9</u><br><br>
i fell on my knees<br>
the moment you left<br>
had me begging "please"<br>
utterly bereft<br>
<br>
i wept away days<br>
just wailing for you<br>
living in a daze<br>
nothing more to do<br>
<br>
but break myself down<br>
i fell to pieces<br>
all over our town<br>
seeking releases<br>
<br>
finding no quarter<br>
for my deep sorrows<br>
i feel much shorter<br>
facing the gallows<br>
<br>
my neck in the noose<br>
at the breaking dawn<br>
i haven't a use<br>
now that you have gone<br>
<br>
reining in my grief<br>
i breathe my last sigh<br>
accepting relief<br>
a whisper "goodbye"<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 24]<br></div>

<p>
<u>8</u><br><br>
killing me with keystrokes<br>
cutting through my cloud<br>
borne of mid-day tokes<br>
and all it enshrouds<br>
<br>
to clench on my heart<br>
with those ice cold claws<br>
which i couldn't part<br>
whilst caught in her jaws<br>
<br>
from all i cared for<br>
here she is again<br>
still seeking to score<br>
not be mine again<br>
<br>
as dead as we are<br>
i feel animated<br>
and though she is far<br>
somehow i'm sated<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 23]<br></div>

<p>
<u>7</u><br><br>
feeble and chilled<br>
fingers afloat<br>
feeling fulfilled<br>
kind of cutthroat<br>
<br>
leaning onto<br>
unforgetting<br>
what is still true<br>
not regretting<br>
<br>
our beauty<br>
or my failure<br>
of that duty<br>
to your altar<br>
<br>
now i just rage<br>
at existence<br>
turning the page<br>
on persistence<br>
<br>
an animal<br>
i scratch symbols<br>
irrational<br>
midnight idols<br>
<br>
just succumbing<br>
to suffering<br>
tired of running<br>
recovering<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 22]<br></div>

<p>
<u>6</u><br><br>
chemicals coiling through my nerves<br>
acidic to my very soul<br>
shorted out with thoughts of her curves<br>
the restless nights have wrought their toll<br>
<br>
on my weary and withered form<br>
for nothing more than poetry<br>
my sickened heart i did deform<br>
resigned of ragged circuitry<br>
<br>
i walk now a different way<br>
speaking again in my own tongue<br>
as though i have something to say<br>
of honey for which i was stung<br>
<br>
knowing words will never express<br>
this immutable torture<br>
the departure of my princess<br>
cannot be described with lecture<br>
<br>
she held me through awful terror<br>
and got me up when i got down<br>
i couldn't do the same for her<br>
no wonder she isn't around<br>
<br>
but i fear not for i am well<br>
weathering pain i once could not<br>
yet still somehow caught in her spell<br>
wondering when this wound will clot<br>
<br>
eating away at my insides<br>
and fumbling from my filthy mouth<br>
just beneath my skin it resides<br>
destroying me from north to south<br>
<br>
i let it fester in me<br>
allowing it to guide my hand<br>
hoping no one will ever see<br>
this horror i cannot withstand<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 21]<br></div>

<u>5</u><br><br>
the memory of her sillouhette<br>
drags me on back through coldwater<br>
as with every cigarette<br>
i'm reminded of my daughter<br>
<br>
and her rightful disapproval<br>
of that nauseating comfort<br>
for which she had but reproval<br>
she whom for now i can't exhort<br>
<br>
to but crawl into my arms<br>
i'm scratching for scraps of some hope<br>
trying to ignore the alarms<br>
and focus on starting to cope<br>
<br>
but honestly i feel unfirm<br>
sick from sensing my baby's gone<br>
wriggling through like an earthworm<br>
searching for courage to move on<br>
<br>
i have found naught but temptations<br>
bent on but bending me wayward<br>
pondering our constellations<br>
my eyes are now transfixed skyward<br>
<br>
dazzled as i am disgruntled<br>
my being begins it's yearning<br>
to untangle what i've crumpled<br>
and forget the hurt i'm learning<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 20]<br></div>

<u>4</u><br><br>
feeling fatigue set in<br>
exhaustion in my bones<br>
evidence of my sin<br>
speaking out in hushed tones<br>
<br>
choking back tears of joy<br>
hidden behind tired eyes<br>
a man made just a toy<br>
for an innocent guise<br>
<br>
rotten on the inside<br>
black fungus grows in me<br>
my chest pried open wide<br>
i set my sickness free<br>
<br>
to plunder weaker men<br>
of their earthly riches<br>
this world but a playpen<br>
just brimming with bitches<br>
<br>
i prowl along my way<br>
a beast wild with hunger<br>
ringing in each new day<br>
with the freshest blunder<br>
<br>
stumbling as i'm prone to<br>
but finding my footing<br>
still fighting back that blue<br>
however i'm fruiting<br>
<br>
sound of soul and of mind<br>
i reconcile myself<br>
and in seeking i find<br>
serenity itself<br>
</p><hr>

<u>3</u><br><br>
winding myself up<br>
just to crash on down<br>
vacant is my cup<br>
wish i would just drown<br>
<br>
i'm breaking apart<br>
spilling on the floor<br>
why did you depart?<br>
living is a chore<br>
<br>
waking up to work<br>
slaving for a wage<br>
alone in the dark<br>
unrelenting rage<br>
<br>
machines on repeat<br>
making minimum<br>
for scraps of mincemeat<br>
a curriculum<br>
<br>
teachings of the damned<br>
preached oft in our church<br>
easily we're scammed<br>
when demons doth lurch<br>
<br>
with pitchforks in hand<br>
they prod us along<br>
but our merry band?<br>
we remain headstrong<br>
<br>
still it is a shame<br>
they are the best known<br>
among the yet tame<br>
living just their bone<br>
<br>
i wrench what i can<br>
from beneath the beast<br>
but i'm but one man<br>
tired of being fleeced<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 16]<br></div>

<u>2</u><br><br>
seeking a prescription<br>
i visit the doctor<br>
to feed my addiction<br>
only a bystander<br>
<br>
sick of my affliction<br>
an absent wanderer<br>
i fight for my passion<br>
whilst encased in amber<br>
<br>
an abomination<br>
hooked on the granular<br>
need an operation<br>
not some competitor<br>
<br>
but an abdication<br>
of all of this clutter<br>
call it aberration<br>
my conciliator<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 15]<br></div>

<p>
<u>1</u><br><br>
a callous cold is creeping in<br>
working her way beneath my skin<br>
she settles someplace deep therein<br>
snuffing me calmly from within<br>
<br>
she grips the embers of my heart<br>
and threatens to tear it apart<br>
should i not seek out a new start<br>
my suffering is but her art<br>
<br>
tumbling away i shake her free<br>
and yet still she claws out at me<br>
praying that she would leave me be<br>
i want only to make her see<br>
<br>
but seeing is not believing<br>
and oft our eyes are decieving<br>
thus i must begin my grieving<br>
for that which i caught her thieving<br>
</p><hr>

please grow up and stay away<br>
<br>
as much as it hurts to say<br>
<br>
haunt me as you will<br>
but leave my corporeal form be<br>
as ghastly is he<br>
he loves you still<br>
<br>
so much so he's sick<br>
on nothing more than you<br>
a chronic and terminal purview<br>
he mistook for angelic<br>
<br>
worshipping the ways of your flesh<br>
with wild abandon<br>
i chased your adulation<br>
worrying not of old wounds made fresh<br>
<br>
i fear that i would run again<br>
careening into your embrace<br>
caring not for your newfound space<br>
i would but build you a new penn<br>
<br>
fit with the furnishings you desire<br>
i would only watch as you wallow<br>
happy at heart but not to follow<br>
you've outgrown your pacifier<br>
