<p>
please grow up and stay away<br>
<br>
as much as it hurts to say<br>
<br>
haunt me as you will<br>
but leave my corporeal form be<br>
as ghastly is he<br>
he loves you still<br>
<br>
so much so he's sick<br>
on nothing more than you<br>
a chronic and terminal purview<br>
he mistook for angelic<br>
<br>
worshipping the ways of your flesh<br>
with wild abandon<br>
i chased your adulation<br>
worrying not of old wounds made fresh<br>
<br>
i fear that i would run again<br>
careening into your embrace<br>
caring not for your newfound space<br>
i would but build you a new penn<br>
<br>
fit with the furnishings you desire<br>
i would only watch as you wallow<br>
happy at heart but not to follow<br>
you've outgrown your pacifier<br>
</p><hr>

<p>
a callous cold is creeping in<br>
working her way beneath my skin<br>
she settles someplace deep therein<br>
snuffing me calmly from within<br>
<br>
she grips the embers of my heart<br>
and threatens to tear it apart<br>
should i not seek out a new start<br>
my suffering is but her art<br>
<br>
tumbling away i shake her free<br>
and yet still she claws out at me<br>
praying that she would leave me be<br>
i want only to make her see<br>
<br>
but seeing is not believing<br>
and oft our eyes are decieving<br>
thus i must begin my grieving<br>
for that which i caught her thieving<br>
</p><hr>

<hr><div class="date">[DEC - 16]<br></div>

<p>
seeking a prescription<br>
i visit the doctor<br>
to feed my addiction<br>
only a bystander<br>
<br>
sick of my affliction<br>
an absent wanderer<br>
i fight for my passion<br>
whilst encased in amber<br>
<br>
an abomination<br>
hooked on the granular<br>
need an operation<br>
not some competitor<br>
<br>
but an abdication<br>
of all of this clutter<br>
call it aberration<br>
my conciliator<br>
