<h1>
fruit forbidden<br>
shes bitten me<br>
im bedridden<br>
her devotee<br>
<br>
wondrously wild<br>
and unconfined<br>
shes all but mild<br>
with that filthy mind<br>
<br>
her beautiful body<br>
haunts me in the best way<br>
adorable kitty<br>
please come on out to play<br>
<br>
smelling you through this screen<br>
my senses seek you out<br>
your sexy little scene<br>
leaves me shaking throughout<br>
<br>
lounging here in longing<br>
fingers stroking smooth skin<br>
pleasurably brimming<br>
I await you herein<br>
<br>
as hideous as i am<br>
beastly and beguiling<br>
wouldn't you be my lamb?<br>
lover so breathtaking
<br><br>&#9733<br><br>
smoking gorilla glue<br>
still thinking about you<br>
so fucking blue<br>
but that love wasnt true<br>
<br>
lust like a lemon drop<br>
so sour on my tongue<br>
can't even make it stop<br>
my vapid heart she's stung<br>
<br>
stuck on some sugar high<br>
sweetly turning sickly<br>
my little butterfly<br>
migrating so quickly<br>
<br>
somatesthetic feel<br>
crawling along my spine<br>
no longer know what's real<br>
telling myself i'm fine<br>
<br>
but i'm spinning<br>
lost, dazed, hurt, and confused<br>
i have to stop binging<br>
so over being used<br>
<br>
need to take a step back<br>
reverse direction now<br>
get it all back on track<br>
make it better somehow<br>
<br>
but why should i want to<br>
when every single thought<br>
brings me right back to you<br>
desperately distraught<br>
<br>
i'm laying it all down<br>
to kiss her waiting feet<br>
with my now upturned frown<br>
sad we could never meet<br>
<br>
i'll party with your ghost<br>
until this emotion<br>
can find another host<br>
swimming in our ocean<br>
<br>
that lusts another way<br>
flavorful but vanilla<br>
much to my dismay<br>
she's switching our genre<br>
<br>
such infidelity<br>
suckling life from me<br>
somberly tending me<br>
i have to let you free<br>
<br>
i'm sorry
