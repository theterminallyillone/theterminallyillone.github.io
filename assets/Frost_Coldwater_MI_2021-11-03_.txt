awakening insulated
you've kept winter at bay
and as the sun slow cooks the west
you get ready for your day

eggs on toast roasts rather quick
when your feet are freezing fast
and you've much to achieve
before this coming day is past

music breaks the silence of dawn
escaping the walls' confines
it soothes you whilst you cook
surviving here amidst the pines

you shake the cold from your bones
rattling the muscle tied down beneath
the skin you've grown accustomed to
accusing the ice in your breath

you hold what's left that's warm
whilst you shiver
and you cram your mouth full
until you've eaten every sliver
