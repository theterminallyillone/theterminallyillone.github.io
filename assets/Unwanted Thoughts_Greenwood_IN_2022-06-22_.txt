unwanted thoughts

killing me with kisses
delegated for him
not much of a mistress
could call her a victim

if she weren't to blame
voraciously playing
she put us both to shame
absolutely slaying

everything i called ours
while i was up in smoke
she was out spending hours
with some disgusting bloke

calling him her daddy
and licking his ice cream
just some fucking fatty
popping in my pipe dream

to use what i called mine
for all of two minutes
this morbid looking swine
reeking of indolence

wanted to wear my crown
now it just feels heavy
just want to put it down
but alternatively

i embraced my princess
and moved on with my queen
but this life isn't chess
sometimes it gets obscene

told me i'm the problem
when she blew all "our" cash
thinking she's burdensome?
no thats not a newsflash

turns out she's an actor
lying like it's her job
should i even bother
to stop and fucking sob?

cut off the nicotene
nothing makes me forget
not even dopamine
i just want to reset

lashing out at my mind
only hurting myself
dosing what i could find
should put it on the shelf

but guess who's still hurting?
i think it's funny though
this sorrowful aching
for some fucking bimbo

that carved my whole life up
with the knife i gave her
waiting for the breakup
our life has been a blur

boring and still stagnant
i lay here in our pool
she's still just as absent
but it's okay, it's cool

i can play this game too
flirting like it's a sport
to find a little boo
i'll playfully extort

i'm fucking spiraling
and spinning like a top
feel myself crumbling
please, can you make this stop?
