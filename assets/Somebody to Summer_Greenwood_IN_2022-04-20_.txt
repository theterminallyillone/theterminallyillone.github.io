somebody to summer

smoking gorilla glue
still thinking about you
so fucking blue
but that love wasnt true

lust like a lemon drop
so sour on my tongue
can't even make it stop
my vapid heart she's stung

stuck on some sugar high
sweetly turning sickly
my little butterfly
migrating so quickly

somatesthetic feel
crawling along my spine
no longer know what's real
telling myself i'm fine

but i'm spinning
lost, dazed, hurt, and confused
i have to stop binging
so over being used

need to take a step back
reverse direction now
get it all back on track
make it better somehow

but why should i want to
when every single thought
brings me right back to you
desperately distraught

i'm laying it all down
to kiss her waiting feet
with my now upturned frown
sad we could never meet

i'll party with your ghost
until this emotion
can find another host
swimming in our ocean

that lusts another way
flavorful but vanilla
much to my dismay
she's switching our genre

such infidelity
suckling life from me
somberly tending me
i have to let you free

i'm sorry
