it's a slow crawl
pushing through the mud
sticking onto me
all elbows
on our knees
we're treading steadily
fumbling for keys
to simpler subsistence
chasing growing seas
and ambitions
roads forgotten
children
borrowed time builds up
and blows up
otherwise quiet rooms
where people lay still
comfortably together now
worried about a bill
but not a vow
I'm longing for a cure
for such an ache
this love so pure
I think I'll break
sick from it all
I shake for you
pray not I fall
for prey to you
then you'd eat me all up
and then clean up
with all the rest
of my contest
with lips I've missed
upon that thing you've kissed
this winter night
there's a premonition
putting you down on me
in submission
I'll give you all of me
