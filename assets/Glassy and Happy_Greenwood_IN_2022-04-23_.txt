dying on the inside
dripping with dependance
so fried and glassy eyed
fighting my tolerance

impatiently tapping
fingertips on vinyl
im asphyxiating
feeling maniacal

sinking into the floor
and shaking like a dog
i can feel my heart soar
when i feel my mind fog

always seeking a fix
for my melancholy
call me a heretic
hooking up with happy

passionate but brittle
i cling to her spirit
trying not to addle
everything with it

but i worry without
before it crashes down
what will i cry about
when i can't even frown
