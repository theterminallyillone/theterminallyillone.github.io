floating on a magic carpet
elongating my tragic thoughts
with smoke from something illicit
as if some earth-bound astronaut

coughing out clouds in my helmet
i'm seeing stars in the distance
life has been feeling desolate
just seeking a simple essence

sipping my chemical cocktail
and tripping all over again
off that stuff that came in the mail
the kind that makes me feel so zen

speaking but it comes out garbled
noise on your answering machine
shouldn't say i haven't dabbled
started smoking weed at eightteen

dying but i'll swear i'm flying
on some kind of spring mating spree
fresh kitten litter following
i've got lambs out looking for me

shaking when i'm off of this high
absence is but a state of mind
sometimes existence is a lie
just don't forget to pay the fine

taxing even to stay alive
i'm struggling to fucking rhyme
put myself into overdrive
and always losing track of time

fucking like theres no tomorrow
because the world's burning today
never return what i borrow
like to leave things in disarray

sexting with both of my hands tied
breathless after our performance
remembering why she's my bride
little queen of adolescence
