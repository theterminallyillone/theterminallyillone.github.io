sleepless and so hungry
i watch as you slumber
resting ever soundly
my loving beholder

beautiful but broken
you lay so innocent
drawing my attention
as if some enchantment

the sweetest strawberry
ripening in my hands
you were grown just for me
to follow my commands

bursting the sweetest juice
this tongue has ever craved
my object of abuse
little girl i've enslaved

like a sexy mirage
you tease me in day-dreams
hitting like a montage
that would inspire regimes

to fight for mating rights
and pillage your body
one of your acolytes
call me a jihadi

for the cause of your love
extraordinarily
you fit me like a glove
fucking me faithfully

i battle to keep up
with your sultry urges
perhaps i need backup
when kitten emerges

to fill up all your holes
you'll need a collective
that has similar goals
to my main objective

just don't go forgetting
of our oath or our bond
lest you start regretting
the man for whom you faun
